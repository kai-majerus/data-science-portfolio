# Data Science Portfolio 🚀
Repository containing data science projects completed by me for self learning and hobby purposes. Take a look at the Contents below and follow the link to the repo / location for each project :) 

## Contents

### Data Analysis and Visualisation 📊
* [Exploratory analysis of Twitch](https://github.com/kai-majerus/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/01-Twitch): Exploratory analysis of a Twitch dataset collected by myself using the [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api). (In Progress)

### Machine Learning 🤖

__Regression__
* [Regression models to predict the 'score' of a football player](https://github.com/kai-majerus/numpy_regression_from_scratch): I built linear, ridge, lasso and tree regression models in NumPy from scratch to predict the score of a player - small dataset. (In Progress)

### Deep Learning 🧠
* [Driver Drowsiness Detection using CNN Model](https://github.com/willgraham29/project_drowsy): I worked on this project in a group at Le Wagon. We detect whether a driver was drowsy using characteristics of yawning and having closed eyes. (In Progress)

### Data Engineering ⚙
* [Taxi Fare Prediction Model](https://github.com/kai-majerus/TaxiFareModel): I trained a model from the Kaggle New York City Taxi Fare Prediction dataset and built a containerized prediction API deployed on Google Cloud Run and then hosted a [small Streamlit application on Heroku](https://kmajerus-taxifareapi.herokuapp.com/) 🌍
