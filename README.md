# Data Science Portfolio 🚀
Repository containing data science projects completed by me for self learning and hobby purposes. Projects contained within one notebook are stored directly in this repo. Larger projects with modular code are stored in separate repos. Take a look at the Contents below and follow the link to the repo / location for each project 🙂

## Contents

### Machine Learning 🤖

__Regression__
* [Regression models to predict the 'score' of a football player](https://github.com/kai-majerus/numpy_regression_from_scratch): I built linear, ridge, lasso and tree regression models in NumPy from scratch to predict the score of a player - small dataset. (In Progress)

### Deep Learning 🧠
* [Driver Drowsiness Detection using CNN Model](https://github.com/willgraham29/project_drowsy): I worked on this project in a group at Le Wagon. We detect whether a driver was drowsy using characteristics of yawning and having closed eyes. Try out the app [here](https://share.streamlit.io/patrickarigg/project_drowsy/cloud-app)

### Data Engineering ⚙
* [Taxi Fare Prediction Model](https://github.com/kai-majerus/TaxiFareModel): I trained a model from the Kaggle New York City Taxi Fare Prediction dataset and built a containerized prediction API deployed on Google Cloud Run and then hosted a [small Streamlit application on Heroku](https://ny-taxi-fare-app.herokuapp.com/) 🌍

### Data Analysis and Visualisation 📊
* [Exploratory analysis of Twitch](https://github.com/kai-majerus/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/01-Data-Analysis-Notebooks): Exploratory analysis of a Twitch dataset collected by myself using the [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api). (In Progress)
